This program should accept a list of numbers as the onlyparameter and returna list that consists ofthe min and max values of the list passed as a parameter.The list passed in may have repeated values.You must implement 2 versions of the program. 1.One version must be written in the functional paradigm using the language Scheme. Your function name must be minmax. You may not use any built-in min or max functions, and must use functional techniques. So, you may not use any imperative looping structures or assignments or things of that nature.The user should be able to execute your minmax function with a function call like the following: (minmax ‘(3 4 6 9 22 203 1 43 8 4))The result of this call would be(1 203)2.The second version must be written in the logic paradigm using the language Prolog. The user should be able to query your program in Prolog in the following way:minmax([3,4,6,9,22,203,1,43,8,4], Result).The result of this query would besomething likeResult = [1,203]•You must have a comment block at the beginning of your program that lists your name, the date, the class number and section and a description of what your program does.This program won’t be graded for comments and things like that outside of the program header.
